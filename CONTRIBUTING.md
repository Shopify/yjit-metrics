We'd love your contributions! I'm sure there's more you'd like to see in yjit-metrics.

If you have questions or problems getting set up, you're probably not the only
one with difficulties. You can [file an issue](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit-metrics/issues)
and we'll answer as soon as we can.

We welcome [GitHub Pull Requests](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit-metrics/pulls) in 
the usual way, though you'll need to sign a Shopify
Contributor License Agreement - when you file the PR a bot should direct you through
the process.

If you're looking for something to do, the
[issue tracker](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit-metrics/issues)
can also be helpful. We try to keep enhancements and bugs marked as such, which
may help you out.

Right now documentation is mostly in the code and in the README.
A PR can be a great way to correct or expand that documentation. If you
see a problem, file an issue or open a PR!
